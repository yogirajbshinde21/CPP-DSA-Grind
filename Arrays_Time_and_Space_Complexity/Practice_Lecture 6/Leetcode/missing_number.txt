Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 
             2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.





Solution:-

class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

        int nums_sum = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            nums_sum+=nums[i];
        }


        // Subtract both sums to get missing value
        return (n*(n+1)/2)-nums_sum;
    }
};
